            specializing in Software Development, and graduated/ finished my
            course in 2019. I seek challenging opportunities where I can fully
            use my skills for the success of the organization. I am generally a
            polite person. Growing up i have always been a passionate about what
            I do and giving it my best. I also learned that no one is perfect
            but we improve and learn with time. I also enjoy solving IT related
            problems. I love and get pleasure from helping other people who
            might need my help.
